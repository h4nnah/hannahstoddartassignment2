	<h2>About Open Access...</h2>
	</header>
	<p>The majority of resources published on the internet is locked behind barriers, forcing people to pay money to access research and science instead of allowing everyone to access information. This is why the open access movement aims to change this by allowing access to knowledge published on the internet without a cost. This would mean people would have access to a larger body of research. <Br>
	Access to knowledge is a privilege that is not shared by everyone, there is a long way to go to change this.
	This open access platform allows people to access and upload resources to the internet without legal issues or a cost. Ensuring people have access to more knowledge at ease. This platform also informs people on the wider Open Access movement and provides people with a variety of resources on this. This is a public platform so anyone can access or upload data to be viewed, sharing and accessing more knowledge they may not have previously known.

	<h2> Our Aim </h2>
	</header>
	<p>The aim of this platform is to share knowledge and resources to the public and make it easier for people to access information without the legal issues and costs associated. <br> This platform also allows researchers and publishers to upload their data without signing away copy rights and share their knowledge to a wider audience which then impacts their professional gain.  </p>

		<h2>Prototype</h2>
	</header>
	<p>
		I have developed this prototype further from my project one as I have introduced a responsive platform for users to access and upload resources. <br>
		My prototype for my website is simple and easy to navigate as the main purpose of this platform is to educate and inform people about the open access movement and to research and upload data. I have designed this, so it is easy to use, and information is displayed clearly for users. There are 4 pages, the landing page, information page, research - displayed in a categoryâ€™s and results page and an upload page. Users can select a category or search a keyword and find informative research others have uploaded to the page. Users can also upload their own work through the upload page by filling in details and attaching a file there. I have attached a responsive prototype with figma below, showing how this website will run.
